# Folders (Mainly for server)
client -> react code
config -> congfiguration files (.env)
middleware -> check authentication between the routes (In the middleware.js, we can write a function that acts as     middleware to get a token from a request and proceeds only when the token is validated.)
        JWT Authentication Middleware: verify SignUp, verify token
    Authorization Middleware: check Userâ€™s roles with record in database
models -> data models
routes -> for express routes
cert -> SSL certification
